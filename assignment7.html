<p class="p1">It was very cold and very windy this week. It snowed many times throughout the day and during the days past. This caused for roads to be very icy and was the cause for many cars to skid off the roads.</p>

<h2 class="date">January 25, 2020</h2>
  
<p class="p2">Went to go see the movie Bad Boys For Life. It was a really good addition to the Bad Boys movies. Going back to weather, it seems to be getting a little better, but there is still ice in some places. I can't tell you how many times I slipped and almost fell. </p>

<h2 class="date">Febuary 07, 2020</h2>
  
<p class="p1">It's snowing today and the weather makes me want to just stay in bed and not move for the entire day. However I am powering through the day and the fact that it is really cold outside doesn't help. The wind feels like it is piercing through my face.</p>

<h2 class="date">Febuary 14, 2020</h2>
  
<p class="p2">Today is Valentine's Day, and it is also Friday. This weekend is a break well deserved. I saw another movie called Birds of Prey starring Margot Robbie as the DC Comics character, Harley Quinn. It was a good movie, but DC could definitly do better since their animated movies have proven so.</p>

<h2 class="date">Febuary 19, 2020</h2>
  
<p class="p1">Spent all day knocking out school work so I can maximize my time studying for two tests I have this week. I'm not super stressed out since the course material is pretty simple, but I should still read over some notes and brush up on some matrices and linear algebra</p>

<h2 class="date">Febuary 29, 2020</h2>
  
<p class="p2">A lot of people I know from Philadelphia came up to State College this weekend, and thankfully I had already completed my work before the weekend began. It was really cold, and snowing, but despite that we still had a good time together. </p>

<h2 class="date">March 2, 2020</h2>
  
<p class="p1">I have another midterm this week, so I'm probabliy going to spend the begining of my week studying for that. But after that I only have spring break to look forward to. While that means I get to go back home to Philly, I'd rather stay in my State College apartment to myself. </p>

<h2 class="date">March 8, 2020</h2>
  
<p class="p2">It's spring break. What that means is minimal work, but instead of risking forgetting everything I learned this semester I might do some reading. Then sleep. Then read. This will go on for a countless cycle untill school starts back up again. I haven't really planned to do anything, but I am always up for something exciting</p>

<h2 class="date">March 12, 2020</h2>
  
<p class="p1">Well Penn State moved their classes online due to the COVID-19 virus that is affecting the world. What an ending to my final year at Penn State! I'll probably still go back to my apartment after Spring Break ends. That's only so I can be more productive. There exists too many distractions back at home.</p>

<h2 class="date">March 16, 2020</h2>
  
<p class="p2">Spring break is over and now it's back to the grind. All though, the grind continues online. This is kind of interesting on how my physical classes will be. Hopefully not much different. Hopefully exams will turn out much easier.</p>

<h2 class="date">March 27, 2020</h2>
  
<p class="p1">Did some spring cleaning today. There was a lot of free time due to the COVID-19 virus. Threw out a lot of memories from when we first moved in. Still grinding out the online classes. Penn State decideded to provide an alternate grading system to compensate for the online classes.</p>

<h2 class="date">March 30, 2020</h2>
  
<p class="p2">I have two tests this week so I am  probabnly going to spend a lot of time studying. Both tests are math classes and both tests will be administered online due to the remote learning situation. Who knew that our final semester at Penn State would've ended so abruptly?</p>
